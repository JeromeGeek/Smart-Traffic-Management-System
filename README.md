# Smart Traffic Management System

An intelligent traffic management system has been developed that utilizes advanced technologies such as Doppler Effect, Digital Image Processing, and OpenCV. The system is capable of monitoring and controlling traffic based on density, detecting overspeeding, extracting license plate numbers, and issuing automatic fines to registered drivers. Additionally, the system can detect accidents and send automatic SOS alerts to emergency services using OpenCV.
